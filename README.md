B) From where you obtained the dataset?( Mention the source and provide the link)
answer(B)-I have selected the dataset according to my convinience.Below is the link for dataset:

C)Within 80 words summarize why you chose the particular algorithm in question A.
answer(C)-I have used this algorithm because its very basic to be used , in this algorithm, I just imported some required modules and libraries , then just defined linear regression and created a regression object, now how do we created the regression , for that we just need a dataset that I have taken from a csv file and on whose basis regression object is made then its ready to predict the prices of house based on what their area is,this algorithm alos helped me to graphically visualize the dependency of price of house on its area and how the linear regression is related to that graph by a straight line approximating all the data of dataset.
Its ready now to take input as a area dataset to predict out the price dataset of all houses.
Thatâ€™s why this algorithm is very basic and hence I used
